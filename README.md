# Grazioso-Salvare:

Java Project was created to track, search, and rescue animals for a company called Grazioso Salvare, a search and rescue animal training company.


# Code functions as follows:

1. Created a Driver.java class as the main software to store an array list for dogs, monkeys, and their attributes.
2. The software's main menu functions to intake new animals and check their attributes such as breed, species, gender, length of body, weight, etc. Reserve animals, Print lists of either Dogs or Monkeys and check if an animal is reserved or not.
3. Created the RescuAnimal.java parent class to hold general attributes such as name, animal type, gender age, etc.
4. The Dog.java class inherits from the parent class RescueAnimal.java to reuse some of the code, with added necessary attributes such as breed.
5. The Monkey.java class also inherits from the parent class RescueAnimal.java and added attributes such as species, tail length, body length, and height.
